# You have to build a "Number Guessing Game," in which a winning number is set to some integer value. The Program should
# take input from the user, and if the entered number is less than the winning number,
# a message should display that the number is smaller and vice versa.

# Instructions:
# 1. You are free to use anything we've studied till now.
# 2. The number of guesses should be limited, i.e (5 or 9).
# 3. Print the number of guesses left.
# 4. Print the number of guesses he took to win the game.
# 5. “Game Over” message should display if the number of guesses becomes equal to 0.

        if guess == guesses:
            print("Game Over!!!")
            break
        else:
            continue
    elif a < num:
