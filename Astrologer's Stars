#Instructions:
# You have to take an integer type variable, and the input of the variable will define the length of the triangle.
# You have to declare another Boolean variable.
# When the value of Boolean is 1 i.e. True, the pattern will be printed as shown above.
# But if the value of Boolean is 0 or false, then the triangle will be printed upside down.

        for j in range(0, i + 1):
            print( "*", end = "")
        print("\n", end = "")

elif bol == False:
